# ManvsMachine.
Play rock paper scissors & Tic tac toe against the computer.
## Introduction:
This was my second project using HTML & CSS and the first one using Javascript. 
So the project contains two games a rock paper scissors game & A Tic tac toe game on the second page.
HTML and CSS for structure and styling and Javascript for functionality.

## Purpose:
Purpose, well most of all the purpose of this project was for me to learn Javascript.
And i did succesfully create two games that would probably have been considered less than mediocre in 1985 hehe.
But Rome was not built in a day and neither is a great programmer! 
## The Rock paper scissors game HTML & CSS part:
### Navbar
The navbar located at the top of the page is a Div element with a height of 100px and a 100% width with a
background color of darkcyan.
In the Div there are two anchor elements each with a image element nested inside them one icon displaying a handscissor
and the other one a Tic tac toe board. The images are rounded and with a white background color, there is also a css
hover effect turning the white background color slightly darker/gray when hovered. First time i used css flex and it 
was very practical.

### The game area







## Navbar
located on top of the website. Three anchor tags in an unordered list, Looks like three big buttons, i styled them to be oval and gave them a suiting color. One color as standard another while hovered and a third when selected.
Also changed the size of the font for smaller screen device.


## Video & Images
All off the media on the website is wrapped in a div, in order to make it responsive. There is a set max and minimum width and height and the content is displayed in the center of the browser.










## My personal thaught on the project
Building this website has been both a dream and a nightmare. See i was not aware the projects had a due date.
That is obviously entierly my own fault.

I have been doing my absoulute best to try and catch up. The last ~3 weeks i have been working on this project day and night. There has not been much sleep my life has only revolved around web developement. Besides the stress and lack off sleep it has been amazing. I am so happy i started the course and only wish i did it sooner.

I learned so many things along the way! For example that coding challenges and accually creating a project is two very
different things! Github, Gitpod, visual studio code. Saving repositories, writing commands in the terminal. The list goes on, best of all is i realize that coding is fun, addictive and rewarding.

It will be a pleasure to continue on this path. The course has my full attention and i am doing my best to catch up. I have made so many misstakes its incredible. I dont know if its in the CI material about how to save the repo in github but that has been an issue that is finally resolved. I have redone major parts off the project 3 times. The positive outcome of that is that i have gotten a much deeper understanding off css. Making the youtube video responsive took me ages but it taught me alot more than how to make a video responsive!

## Formating, Validating, Testing & Final Photos
The Html Css and Javascript has been validated by the resources mentioned above and there are 
photos of it below. The index.html had a few opinions on the absence of 'alt=""' for the playerHand
and computerHand images and some empty header and span elements but they are only empty until the 
Javascript says otherwise.

The code has been tested by myself using dev tools and also through my mobile.
The code is validated and formated both the css and the html has been approved.
